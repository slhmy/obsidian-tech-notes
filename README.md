# obsidian-tech-notes

My personal notes on tech stuff.
I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to manage them.

**Please note that I'm using Simplified Chinese (简体中文) in some notes.**
This repo is more likely a personal backup,
so I don't have plans to translate them into English.
There will also be some web links to China websites,
which may not be accessible in some regions.

If you find this repo useful, feel free to use it as a reference.

You won't see `.obsidian` folder since they are mostly personal settings,
which are not necessary to be shared.
But I will share some useful plugins and settings here to provide a better experience for you.

## Recommended Plugins

> The list will not include sync plugins like
> [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save)
> or
> [Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git).
> I don't see so many reasons to recommend them here.

- [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title)
    with `Graph` / `Explore` override feature **enabled**.
- [Code Styler](https://github.com/mayurankv/Obsidian-Code-Styler)
    with line number and customized header.
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/Pierrad/obsidian-github-copilot)
    make auto-completion usable in Obsidian.

## Other Hints

I'm not so familiar with Math syntax in Markdown,
so I record the document entry
[here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Advanced+formatting+syntax#Math)
.
